An implementation of a Swype-like clone in C# for Unity.


This project is a branch of iSwipe for iOS by wyndwarrior. The
company I work for have been looking for a Swype alternative to
use in projecteir.

We have decided to use this implementation not only because of
licensing costs, but mainly because we have access to source code
which we can modify and improve for our own purposes. Because this
is not Swype, and we don't want to confuse people looking for the
real Swype, I have decided to call this project NotSwipe.

The original source was in Objective-C, and made heavy use of
Apple's libraries. Because we are working with Unity, we chose
to use C# and make use of similar functions it provides for us.

Our goal is to have a Swype-like system for an on-screen keyboard
in Unity. Currently, our focus is on Windows due to the nature of
projecteir. However, our implementations in NotSwipe should work
for any system supported by Unity.
